# Character could either tranverse map or stay in one place and fight waves of enemies
	# If tranversing actual map, logic for map and possible key combinations need to be filled out
		# This would take a significantly higher amount of time due to needing to come up with map, logic for map
		# May require external graphics engine
	# If fighting waves of enemies, no logic needed to keep finding enemies/loot
		# There needs to be some sense of ramping difficulty or progression
			# amount of XP gained could scale difficulty of enemies
			# amount of distance travelled could also scale enemies
				# will XP gained be a flat amount or scaled random?
			# logic in enemy init needs to be able to be variable
				# maybe an XP check?
# Character's set stats determine different game elements
	# Strength determines flat damage output
	# Perception increases likeliness to find items
	# Endurance allows for more AP (action points) per combat turn, allowing for more actions, also boosts HP gain/reduces HP loss
	# Charisma increases probability of positive outcomes when interacting with NPCs or intimidating enemies
	# Intelligence allows for better crafting options
	# Agility gives a higher probability of being able to attack twice, or dodge an enemies attack
	# Luck increases crit chance and rarity of items
	
# Game logic
	# Player should be able to look around for an item, "progress through the world"
		# Player could walk for sense of direction, maybe record a meters travelled stat for progression
	# Game loop and game actions need to check stats of player in order to adjust probabilities accordingly
	# Crafting mechanics
		# Crafting/inventory information needs to be shared within functions
		# Inventory is tied to player class while crafting would be a function with a player inventory check
			# player would need to be passed as parameter
		# Higher intelligence would allow for better weapons to be crafted
		# Crafting items could be found by looking around	
	# Need loop break for player death or quitting - record and display character stats on a death screen
	# Conditional to check if player has checked inventory, crafted, walked forward, looked for an item
	# Chance of enemy attacking player after they've completed any of the above tasks
		# maybe enemies are more likely to appear when walking/progressing forward
		
# Combat mechanics
	# Enemy is init at beginning of combat, given stats scaled on the players level and distance travelled
	# When entering combat, player gets AP dependent on their endurance stat
	# AP is used whenever checking inventory, using an item, swinging at enemy, attempting to intimidate, or attempting to run away
	# Enemy will attack once player either uses all their AP or chooses to pass their turn
	# Could have player and enemy limbs mechanic, and you target your opponent based on what part of the body you're targeting
		# Requires limb stats for both player and enemy classes
	# Weapons could have a bleed mechanic where it does damage over time
	# Chance of both player and enemy missing based on perception check
	# Chance of critical hit based on luck stat, does additional damage
	# Agility stat check could allow player to dodge, or attack twice
	# Charisma check could allow player to intimidate enemy and cause them to flee, gives minor XP gain
	# Agility check could give player higher probability of being able to flee, no XP gain
	# Defeating enemy gives most possible XP gain

# Inventory/item mechanics
	# items could be equipment (swords, shields, armor)
	# items could be crafting resources (stone, copper, wood, string, feathers, iron, leather, etc)
	# items could be given upon travelling a distance (small chance) or given when searching for resources (higher chance esp for crafitng materials)
	
# levelling
	# xp and distance scales enemies
	# xp gained from defeating or intimidating enemies, or crafting new equipment
	# xp levels allow player to increment one of their stats (more max hp, more stats)
	# when a player levels up their hp is set to their max HP
